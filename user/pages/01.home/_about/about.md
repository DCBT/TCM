![](abouttom.jpj.jpg?resize=200,200)Tom has been a professional musician all of his adult life. At age 16 he joined the Royal Marines Band Service, studying at the RM School of Music in Portsmouth, UK. During this time he travelled the world playing music, and in 2010 came to New Zealand. He liked it so much he decided to stay, and joined the Royal New Zealand Navy Band in 2012. His experience in the RNZ Navy Band took him travelling throughout NZ and the South Pacific, performing piano and French Horn. 

Tom attained his BMUS in Classical Performance specialising in French Horn and Conducting. Whilst performing around the globe, he managed to attend a number of colleges, studying at the University of Portsmouth, the Royal College of Music and later the University of Auckland.

Tom took up the baton of the North Shore Concert Band, and later Manukau Concert Band, winning top awards in the NZCBA Festival in both 2015 and 2016. Also in 2016, he was appointed Director of Music for the Kingâ€™s College Band Program in which the Premier Band were invited to perform in the KBB Gala concert that year. A busy year for Tom, as during this time he also graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelors of Music in Classical Performance.

Currently Tom works as a freelance musician playing French Horn for the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and a number of orchestras around NZ as well as piano in his Lounge Duo _PTT._

Tom has always taught whilst being a professional musician but has decided to devote himself to freelance work and teaching, wanting to pass on his wealth of knowledge and experience to  future generations.
